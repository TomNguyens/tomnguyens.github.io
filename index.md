### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

  My favorite portion of Lab 6 was part 2, as I've always been interested in the mechanics of the blackjack game. For the first time, I was able to create routines that determine a blackjack hand's right value regardless of the number of aces given.

* Lab 7

  Since Lab 7 Part 1 involves date calculations in a practical situation, it was another one of my favorite labs. As a consequence, I now understand how to handle date-related functions and command-line inputs better. Pretty great lab to do.

* Lab 12

  Parts 1 and 2 of Lab 12 were excellent resources for learning. It revealed new capabilities for graphic manipulation, such merging two gifs. I learned about the Magik API as well.
